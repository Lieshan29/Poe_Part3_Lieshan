MAST – POE
I’ve started off by making the colour scheme of the website in a minimalistic white, black, grey and red. On the home page the logo of the chef is displayed so users know who’s work they are looking at. As you enter the home page, you are greeted by a button which allows you to view the full menu available. 
After selecting this button you will see that the first page contains a list of all the dishes available. This contains an image of the dish, the name of the dish as well as the description of the dish.
There are four filter buttons at the top of the page; Main course, Starters, Drinks, Desserts. All of these buttons filter each dish to be displayed under its class. 
The user interface is user friendly and aesthetic to the user. Everything is displayed clearly such as the text for the descriptions or titles and the images displaying the dish.
